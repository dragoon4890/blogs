I was thinking of making this personal project for a long period of time. It has been maybe like 2 months 
since i thought of it. Leaving that part aside, a TTS ( text to speech) model is crucial for the thought 
project.

So its right now 3 am when i start with that. 

First thing, I do is, I start researching about small models, I dont really want to use a big model, as I want
to run this on phones. 

At quick glance, kokoro 82m looks neat, need to try that. 

According to the huggingface page, it looks like this uses something called G2P model, not sure what is that, 
maybe read about it later.

I will test this tomorrow on my pc, how to configure and all. If works properly, next step would to optimize
the inference for android.
